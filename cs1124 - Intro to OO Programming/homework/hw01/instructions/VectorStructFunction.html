<h3>Problem: </h3>
<p>
  We will model a game of medieval times. Our world is filled with
  warriors. Naturally what warriors like to do is fight. To the
  death. So we happily let them.</p>
<p>Each warrior starts out with a name and a certain amount of
strength. Each time he fights, he loses some strength. (He gets to
keep his name.) If his opponent is stronger than he is, then he
loses <em>all</em> of his strength, in which case he is dead, or at
the very least pretty useless as a fighter. Otherwise he loses as much
strength as his opponent had. Of course, if he and his opponent had
the same strength then they are both losers.</p>
<p>Even losers are allowed to pick a fight. It doesn't require having
any strength in order to do battle with someone else. Not that you
stand much of a chance of winning anything, but perhaps it's worth
getting beaten (again) just to have those 15 seconds of fame.</p>
<p>Your program will read in a file of commands. There are three types
of commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><u>Warrior</u></code> creates a new warrior with the
  specified name and strength. </li>
  <li><code><u>Battle</u></code> causes a battle to occur between two
  warriors. </li>
  <li><code><u>Status</u></code> lists all warriors, alive or dead,
  and their strengths. </li>
</ul>
<p>A sample input file looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>Warrior	Jim	42<br>
    Warrior	Lancelot 15<br>
    Warrior Arthur 15<br>
    Warrior Torvalds 20<br>
    Warrior Gates 8<br>
    Status<br>
    Battle Arthur Lancelot<br>
    Battle Jim Lancelot<br>
    Battle Torvalds Gates<br>
    Battle Gates Lancelot<br>
    Status</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The name of the input file will be &quot;warriors.txt&quot;. Note
  that the commands do not have to appear in that order. The only
  requirement is that a Battle command cannot appear until the
  specified warriors have been seen.</p>
<p>
  The Status command displays how many warriors there, then displays
  each one with his strength. The Warrior command does not display
  anything.  The Battle command displays one line to says who is
  fighting whom and a second line to report the results, as shown
  below.</p>
<p>
  The output (which would display on the screen) for this file should
  look like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>There are: 5 warriors<br>
    Warrior: Jim, strength: 42<br>
    Warrior: Lancelot, strength: 15<br>
    Warrior: Arthur, strength: 15<br>
    Warrior: Torvalds, strength: 20<br>
    Warrior: Gates, strength: 8<br>
    Arthur battles Lancelot<br>
    Mutual Annihilation: Arthur and Lancelot die at each other's hands<br>
    Jim battles Lancelot<br>
    He's dead Jim<br>
    Torvalds battles Gates<br>
    Torvalds defeats Gates<br>
    Gates battles Lancelot<br>
    Oh, NO!  They're both dead!  Yuck!<br>
    There are: 5 warriors<br>
    Warrior: Jim, strength: 42<br>
    Warrior: Lancelot, strength: 0<br>
    Warrior: Arthur, strength: 0<br>
    Warrior: Torvalds, strength: 12<br>
    Warrior: Gates, strength: 0</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Programming guidelines </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    For all assignments, please use the aspects of the language that
    we are focusing on in the assignment.  For example, in this
    assignment, one of the topics is the use of struct.  That means we
    do <em>not</em> want you to define classes or methods, or to use
    data hiding &emdash; that'll all be in the next assignment.
    (Obviously, you shouldn't worry if you don't know what I was just
    talking about there.)  Why the restrictions?  The purpose of each
    assignment is to have you excercise specific technical skills.  If
    you want to wow us with the cool stuff you have figured out that
    goes beyond the current syllabus, great!  Come by the office and I
    will be happy to look at and discuss your work.</li>
  <li>
    Make <em>good use</em> of functions. In this program, for example,
    when you determine that you are looking at a Warrior command then
    you should call a function to handle that command. Similarly with
    the other commands. </li>
  <li>
    Begin your file with a comment identifying who you are and what
    this program is for. </li>
  <li>
    If there are any <em>known</em> problems with your program include
    a comment explaining them. You <em>have</em> carefully tested your
    program, right?  </li>
  <li>
    The program should have a "reasonable" amount of <em>useful</em>
    comments.</li>
  <li>
    The code must be well formatted. <em>Never</em> turn in code with
    bad indentation.</li>
  <li>
    All structs, functions and variables should have <em>good</em>
    names.
    <ul>
      <li>Function names should clearly identify what the function does.</li>
      <li>A variable name that is a single letter, such
      as <code>i</code>, should only be used within the scope of a
      loop as a loop index.  Ok, yes, x and y might make excellent
      names for referring to the coordinate of a point in 2D
      space. </li>
      <li><code>temp</code> is almost never a good name. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the convention that structs begin with an uppercase letter,
    constants are all uppercase and functions and variables begin with
    a lowercase letter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn in</h3>
<p>Hand in a single cpp file, hw01.cpp, containing your program.</p>
<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>Raise them on the Discusion Board on My Poly.</p>
